Here you can view and select your classes to begin taking attendance or view the overall attendance record of the students that have added that class.

### Taking Attendance
This will start taking attendance for the day. There is a *Five minute* time limit for the students to mark themselves as present. 

Attendance requires the student's presence and so the app does too. It will only allow a student to mark themselves as present if they are physically in class.
### Manage Courses
